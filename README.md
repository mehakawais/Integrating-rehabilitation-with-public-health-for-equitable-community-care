## 📘 Introduction

**Integrating Rehabilitation with Public Health for Equitable Community Care** is a research-driven project that emphasizes the importance of incorporating **rehabilitation services within public health systems**.  
It highlights the necessity of creating **inclusive, equitable, and community-oriented healthcare models** that ensure every individual has access to rehabilitation as part of overall health and well-being.

The study aligns with the **World Health Organization (WHO) Rehabilitation 2030 Agenda** and contributes to the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** by promoting universal access to health services, reducing inequality, and improving quality of life for all.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Study

The purpose of this project is to explore how **rehabilitation and public health** can be effectively integrated to achieve **equitable community care**.

### Specific Objectives:
1. To analyze the role of rehabilitation within the broader public health framework.  
2. To identify gaps, challenges, and opportunities in current rehabilitation policies.  
3. To propose models for integrating rehabilitation across all levels of healthcare.  
4. To suggest strategies that promote accessibility, equity, and sustainability.  
5. To align recommendations with WHO global rehabilitation and health policy frameworks.

## 🧩 Conceptual Framework

The research proposes a **multilevel framework** that connects rehabilitation with preventive, promotive, and community-based public health actions.  
This framework focuses on:
- **Integration** across primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare levels.  
- **Community-based approaches** that empower individuals and local systems.  
- **Policy and system strengthening** for sustainable implementation.  
- **Workforce capacity building** through interprofessional collaboration.  
- **Monitoring and evaluation** to ensure continuous improvement.

---

## 🧠 Rationale

Rehabilitation is often viewed as a post-treatment service rather than a **core component of public health**.  
Integrating rehabilitation into health systems ensures:
- Continuity of care from prevention to recovery.  
- Reduced disability burden and improved quality of life.  
- Enhanced participation, inclusion, and functional independence.  
- Stronger and more resilient health systems capable of addressing long-term needs.

## 📈 Recommendations

- Embed rehabilitation into **primary healthcare policies** and service delivery models.  
- Ensure **financial and institutional support** for rehabilitation workforce training.  
- Establish **multi-sectoral partnerships** for integrated care delivery.  
- Strengthen **data systems** to monitor rehabilitation access and outcomes.  
- Promote **public awareness** on the role of rehabilitation in community health.

## 🌍 Significance of the Study

This work underscores that **rehabilitation is not a luxury, but a necessity** for equitable health systems.  
Integrating rehabilitation with public health ensures that individuals—especially those in marginalized or low-resource settings—receive continuous and comprehensive care throughout their lives.

The integration supports:
- Universal Health Coverage (UHC)  
- Disability inclusion and empowerment  
- Social equity and community well-being  
- Strengthened public health infrastructure
